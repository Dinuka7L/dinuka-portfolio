        <b>MERN Authentication System </b><br /><br />
          The <b>D Auth</b> project is a full-stack authentication system I built using the <b>MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)</b>. It focuses on secure user management with modern security practices like <b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</b>, <b>Email Verification</b>, <b>Password Reset with Strength Meter</b>, and <b>JWT-based authentication</b>, all while delivering a clean, responsive UI built with <b>Tailwind CSS</b>.<br /><br />

          <b>Key Capabilities:</b><br />
          <b>End-to-End Authentication Flow:</b>

          <p>From <b>user registration</b> to <b>profile management</b>, the system covers all essential authentication steps, ensuring a smooth and secure login experience. Protected routes enforce strong access control at both frontend and backend levels.</p><br />

          <b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</b>

          <p>Integrated using <b>Speakeasy</b> and <b>QR code generation</b>, MFA provides an additional security layer, demonstrating real-world enterprise-level practices.</p><br />

          <b>Email-Based Security:</b>

          <p>Users verify their accounts and reset passwords through secure, tokenized email links. Email templates are customizable, making the system adaptable for production-ready deployments.</p><br />

          <b>Modern UI/UX with React + Tailwind:</b>

          <p>A fully responsive interface designed with Tailwind CSS and React components, ensuring accessibility and usability across devices. Profile picture upload and interactive password strength indicators improve user experience.</p><br />

          <b>Technical Highlights:</b>

          <p>The backend is structured with <b>modular controllers, routes, middleware, and utilities</b>, enforcing clean architecture and maintainability. Passwords are hashed with <b>bcrypt</b>, and authentication is secured using <b>JWTs</b> with middleware-based validation. On the frontend, <b>Zustand</b> is used for global state management, and Vite ensures a fast development workflow.</p><br />

          <b>Learning Outcomes as a Developer:</b><br />

          <p>Through this project, I deepened my knowledge in:<br /> - Implementing <b>secure authentication workflows</b> with real-world practices like MFA and JWT.<br /> - Applying <b>best practices in backend security</b>, including password hashing, token-based sessions, and middleware authorization.<br /> - Designing <b>scalable project structures</b> for large applications using clear separation of concerns.<br /> - Enhancing frontend development skills with <b>state management, responsive design, and UX best practices</b>.<br /> - Configuring <b>environment variables</b> and deployment setups that mimic production-ready environments.<br /></p><br />

          <b>The Academia Quiz LMS Platform Help Students Face Exam with more confidence and readiness</b><br /><br />
          The <b>Academia</b> is a Single-Page Application(all data and content processed on client-side) LMS web application I built to help my peer fellow students prepare for their 1st Year ITC-Exam in the Management Program at FMSC of USJ<br />
          <br /><b>Stats and Analytics</b>
          <br />Within the first 3 days of launch the LMS got close to 600 New Users with 23,000  Edge Requests (1st Week of deployment) reported by Vercel and google analytics. The LMS is still in its early stages, but the initial response has been overwhelmingly positive, with users praising its user-friendly interface and effective learning tools.
          <br /><br /><b>Key Capabilities:</b><br />
          <b>Real Exam Feels, Without the Pressure:</b>
          <p>I created an enviorment to simulate<b>exam-based quizzes</b> that mimics the real exam. So it isn't just about memorizing; it's about getting comfortable with the exam format, managing your time, and building that crucial exam-day stamina.</p><br />
          
          <b>Mastering One Concept at a Time:</b>
          <p>Sometimes you just need to drill down on a specific topic. That's where our <b>lesson-focused quizzes</b> come in. They let you dive deep into particular lessons, ensuring you grasp every concept before moving on.</p><br />
          
          <b>More Than Just Multiple Choice:</b>
          <p>We know learning isn't one-size-fits-all. That's why Academia supports a <b>vast array of question types</b>. This keeps things engaging and truly tests your understanding, not just your ability to pick A, B, or C.</p><br />
          <p><b> Build & Technical Highlights</b>
            <br />This SPA Application quiz platform was architected to run entirely client-side, leveraging React with Vite for lightning-fast development and performance. I managed state using Zustand, combined with localStorage to persist user progress seamlessly across page reloads and even browser restartsâ€”without any backend or server dependencies.
            <br /><br />To deliver a smooth, realistic quiz experience, I implemented an efficient question randomization system using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm, ensuring each attempt feels fresh and unpredictable.
            <br /><br />Answer evaluation goes beyond exact matchesâ€”I incorporated a robust fuzzy matching approach based on Levenshtein distance to gracefully handle typos and minor answer variations, especially for fill-in-the-blank and essay responses.

          <b>DNotes â€“ Fullstack MERN Notes App with Rate Limiting and Clean UI</b><br /><br />
          <b>DNotes</b> is a modern, fullstack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application designed to help users create and manage notes seamlessly. Built using <b>React + Vite</b> for the frontend and <b>Express.js + MongoDB</b> for the backend, the app demonstrates key architectural patterns in fullstack development, including API design, state management, rate-limiting, and production deployment practices.<br /><br />

          <b>Key Features:</b><br />
          - <b>Note Creation & Management:</b><br />
          Users can add, view, and delete notes through an intuitive interface. The backend uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store note data in a structured format, supporting rapid data retrieval and scalability.<br /><br />

          - <b>Rate-Limited API with Upstash Redis:</b><br />
          A custom Express middleware powered by <b>Upstash Redis</b> restricts excessive API usage to ensure backend stability and prevent abuse. Each request is evaluated based on IP using a token bucket algorithm with configurable limits.<br /><br />

          - <b>Clean and Responsive Frontend UI:</b><br />
          The React-based UI leverages modern component-based architecture with <b>React Router</b> for SPA navigation. Users can switch between pages like "All Notes" and "Create Note" smoothly, with real-time feedback on actions.<br /><br />

          - <b>Axios Integration:</b><br />
          Frontend API interactions are powered by a reusable <code>axios.js</code> wrapper to handle requests and errors uniformly. This centralization improves maintainability and simplifies debugging.<br /><br />

          - <b>Environment-Aware Deployment:</b><br />
          In <code>development</code> mode, the backend and frontend run independently for faster iteration. In <code>production</code>, the backend serves the built frontend from <code>front-end/dist</code>, enabling single-host deployment using platforms like Vercel or Render.<br /><br />

          - <b>Navigation via React Router:</b><br />
          The app uses <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> components to handle routing between views. Dynamic and static paths are supported to allow a flexible navigation structure.<br /><br />

          - <b>Custom Logging & Middleware:</b><br />
          Requests are logged with method and path for debugging. Express middlewares are layered for parsing JSON, handling CORS (in dev), and enforcing rate limits.<br /><br />

          <b>Project Structure:</b><br />
          - <b>Back-End:</b> Organized into <code>controllers</code>, <code>routes</code>, <code>models</code>, and <code>middleware</code> folders. MongoDB is connected via Mongoose using environment variables stored in <code>.env</code>.<br />
          - <b>Front-End:</b> Built with Vite and React, includes <code>components</code> for UI, <code>lib</code> for utilities like Axios config, and <code>pages</code> for views. Styles are defined in <code>index.css</code> for global control.<br /><br />

          <b>How It Showcases MERN Stack Mastery:</b><br />
          - Demonstrates complete backend setup including database, routes, middleware, and controllers.<br />
          - Shows understanding of async handling, CORS, and environment configuration.<br />
          - Implements frontend API interaction with modular Axios and router-based navigation.<br />
          - Includes practical rate-limiting using Redis and production-grade serving logic.<br /><br />
